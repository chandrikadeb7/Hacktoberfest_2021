# Reverse Cipher

## Aim

The user enters a string , to implement Reverse Cipher Cryptography
on the inputted string.


## Purpose

The purpose is to explore Cryptography methods on strings and try it in python.


## Short description of package/script

- The user enters a string.
- To reverse the input string


## Workflow of the Project

revers_cipher --> It is a function , which takes in the variable in which ,
                  a user input string is scored

Note : Since in reverse Cipher the working remains the same. i.e to reverse the 
       inputted string , hence I haven't segregated encryption and decryption as inputs.



## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. A string is input , which has to be enrypted/decrypted.
2. Passing the input parameter to the revers_cipher function.
3. revers_cipher returns the reversed string , and output is printted

Make a function in Python that can find out the Fibonacci value of a nth number.

A explanation of the fibonacci sequence found  here from: (https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html)


The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!
Example: the next number in the sequence above is 21+34 = 55

Go ahead and try it out! :)

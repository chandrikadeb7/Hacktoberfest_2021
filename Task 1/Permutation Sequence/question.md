[**Permutation Sequence**](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/)
Difficulty: *Hard*

The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
```
    "123"
    "132"
    "213"
    "231"
    "312"
    "321"
```
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note:
- Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```

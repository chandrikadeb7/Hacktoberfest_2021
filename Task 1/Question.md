# House Allocation

There are N houses for sale. The i-th house costs _Ai_ euros to buy. You have a budget of B euros to spend.

What is the maximum number of houses you can buy?

### Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.  Then ,T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a single line 
containing the two integers N and B. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai, the cost of the i-th house.

### Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum number of houses you can buy.

### Limits

Time limit:  15 seconds per test set.
Memory limit: 1GB.
1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
1 ≤ B ≤ 105.
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000, for all i.

### Test set 1
1 ≤ N ≤ 100.

### Test set 2
1 ≤ N ≤ 105.

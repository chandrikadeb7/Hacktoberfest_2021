Given an array A1,A2…AN, find the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) required to convert all integers in A to 0.

In one operation, you

choose a non-negative integer p (p≥0),
select at most K indices in the array A, and
for each selected index i, replace Ai with Ai⊕2p. Here, ⊕ denotes bitwise XOR.
Input
The first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N, K - the size of the array and the maximum number of elements you can select in an operation.
The second line of each test case contains N integers A1,A2…AN.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array 0.

Constraints
1≤T≤105
1≤N,K≤105
0≤Ai≤109
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

Sample Output
5
Explanation
Here is one way to achieve [0,0,0] from [3,6,10] in 5 operations:

1 Choose p=0 and indices {1}. Now A becomes [2,6,10].
2 Choose p=1 and indices {1,2}. Now A becomes [0,4,10].
3 Choose p=1 and indices {3}. Now A becomes [0,4,8].
4 Choose p=2 and indices {2}. Now A becomes [0,0,8].
5 Choose p=3 and indices {3}. Now A becomes [0,0,0].
6 It can be shown that at least 5 operations are required.

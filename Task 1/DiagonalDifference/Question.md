# Diagonal difference
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix <i>arr</i>  is shown below:

1 2 3 </br>
4 5 6 </br>
9 8 9 </br>

The left-to-right diagonal = 1 + 5 + 9. The right to left diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17.  Their absolute difference is | 15 - 17 | = 2.

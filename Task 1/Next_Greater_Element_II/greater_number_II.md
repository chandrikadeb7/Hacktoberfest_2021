Given a number n, find the smallest number that has the same set of digits as n and is greater than n. If n is the greatest possible number with its set of digits, then print “not possible”.

Examples: 
For simplicity of implementation, we have considered the input number as a string. 

Input:  n = "218765"
Output: "251678"

Input:  n = "1234"
Output: "1243"

Input: n = "4321"
Output: "Not Possible"

Input: n = "534976"
Output: "536479"
